The chance to see the amazing Redwoods is something you and your traveling partner will not soon forget. Located along U.S. 101 between Crescent City and Orick, Calif., the park is about a four-hour drive from The Wine Country Inn.</p>\n<p>When people were heading west to California in the 1800s, they discovered gold and redwoods. These massive trees were cut down and sold as lumber and over the next 100 years, the number of redwoods was reduced to just a fraction of what originally stood. In the 1920s, three state parks were formed to help protect the redwoods. Congress took it a step further in 1968 when it created the Redwood National Forest, which is jointly managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park Service.</p>\n<p>What you&rsquo;ll see: In addition to the redwood trees, which are the tallest trees in the world (the largest are the sequoia), you&rsquo;ll also see wildlife, including the Roosevelt Elk. Take a scenic drive, a short walk or a long hike. No matter your skill level, you&rsquo;ll enjoy a trek into the unforgettable Redwood National Forest. Visit the website for info on the wildlife that lives there, as well as all of <strong><a title=\"the things you can do in the park\" href=\"http://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/things2do.htm\">the things you can do in the park</a></strong>.

When you&rsquo;re there, be sure to visit the Golden Gate Bridge, which is actually named for the body of water it spans &ndash; the Golden Gate Straight. Your options for experiencing the iconic bridge include driving over it, walking over it biking over it or simply sitting on one side of the bridge or the other and taking it all in. A trip to San Francisco is not complete without a visit to the trendy <strong><a title=\"Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf\" href=\"http://www.fishermanswharf.org/explore.html\">Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf</a></strong>.
