  "long_description": "<p>The <strong>Napa Valley harvest season</strong> is one of the most magical times of the year to visit Wine Country. Every year from August through October, winemakers and workers race against nature to pick their grapes at the peak of ripeness. They must get them into the fermenter at just the right time to start making wine. As the season goes on, the grapes will have begun happily fermenting in their tanks giving the entire valley the aroma of new wine. A special energy is created from the buzz of newcomers and busy vineyard workers. This is one of the peak seasons to travel to Napa Valley because there is so much to do! Just make sure you take the time to pause and smell the sweet scent of fermentation in the air.</p>\n<p>The unique spirit of the <strong>Napa Valley harvest season</strong> will especially be prevalent at the <a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/\">Wine Country Inn &amp; Cottages</a> because our property is surrounded by beautiful fields filled with ripening grapes. This is also a prime time to visit some of our <a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/wine-tasting-experiences/\">winery partners</a> to see the harvest in action!</p>\n<h4>Napa Valley Harvest Season Stages</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.napavalley.com/blog/napa-valley-harvest-season/\">Napa Valley harvest season</a> lasts for about 3 months. During this time, there are different stages of grape picking. The start of the &ldquo;crush&rdquo; begins with the grapes used to produce sparkling wines. White wine grapes are picked directly after. The harvest continues throughout October and potentially even into early November for red varieties. The grapes used to make red wine usually take a bit longer to mature, particularly the Cabernet Sauvignon. The last of the grapes can be harvested into December. This fruit is left on the vine longer than usual to form more highly concentrated sugars and produces late-harvest wines. At the conclusion of the Napa Valley harvest season, winemakers can finally take a moment to relax and admire the crop they have produced.</p>\n<h4>Wineries During Napa Valley Harvest Season</h4>\n<p><strong>Wine Tasting During Napa Valley Harvest Season</strong></p>\n<p>The Napa Valley harvest season is an optimal time for visitors to tour wineries because there is an opportunity to see workers harvesting the grapes as well as crushing them into wine.
