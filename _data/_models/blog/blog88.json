  "long_description": "<p>Standing beside the tallest trees on Earth is an awe-inspiring experience. The natural wonder and beauty that surrounds the massive redwood trees is impossible to replicate and can only be experienced at the <a title=\"Redwood National Park\" href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Redwood National Park</a>. But there is so much more to this extraordinary park than the redwood trees. From hiking and camping to wildlife and birdwatching, the possibilities are endless.</p>\n<h4>Here Are 10 Unique Facts About the Redwood National Park</h4>\n<p><strong>1. Redwood National Park is home to 2,000-year-old redwoods.</strong></p>\n<p>Officially, the oldest living coast redwood is at least 2,200 years old, but foresters believe some coast redwoods may be much older. You can meet up with old-growth redwoods at Big Basin Redwoods State Park on trails such as the Redwood Trail, the Berry Creek Falls loop, and the Sunset-Timms-Skyline loop. Be sure to obtain a copy of the Redwood National Park map so you can easily plan your route.</p>\n<p><strong>2. You can drive through a redwood tree.</strong></p>\n<p>The famous drive-through tree is located in Redwood National and Park. The Wawona Tree used to be a giant sequoia in <a title=\"Yosemite National Park\" href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yosemite National Park</a> when it fell over in 1969 due to heavy snowfall.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The Redwood National Park is famous!</strong></p>\n<p>Redwood National Park has been a popular location for many films. The Endor scenes for Star Wars Episode 6: Return of the Jedi were filmed in the Tall Trees Redwood Grove. Some scenes from The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Outbreak were filmed near Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.</p>\n<p><strong>4. The park is home to many species of animals.</strong></p>\n<p>Many types of animals, including endangered species like mountain lions, coho salmon, and marbled murrelet make their home in Redwood National Park. Amphibians, beetles, crickets, worms, millipedes, spiders and mollusks, chipmunks, fishers, peregrine falcons, bald eagles, the Northern spotted owl and dozens of other species also call the park home.</p>\n<p><strong>5. You can go camping there.</strong></p>\n<p>There are three campgrounds in the woodland areas of the park and one on the coast. There are also designated camping areas in the backcountry for those who wish to travel through the park on foot. Permits must be obtained in some situations and day-use fees apply in the state parks. If camping is not the ideal Redwood National Park lodging for your party, consider Napa wine country lodging options, such as Wine Country Inn, to compliment your outdoor adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The climate does not fluctuate.</strong></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best time to visit Redwood National Park, you can plan a trip any time of year. The climate remains cool and comfortable all year long, thanks to the large trees. You can expect temperatures to remain between 40-60 degrees, and there is usually a lot of fog, which provides much of the moisture needed by the trees.</p>\n<p><strong>7. The park experiences a lot of seismic activity.</strong></p>\n<p>The park is close to three major tectonic plates, which means that the area is prone to lots of seismic activity or earthquakes. The coastline of the area is also a tsunami hazard zone. These natural disasters have not deterred the survival of the enormous trees. Amazingly, the redwoods have developed a system for protecting themselves. Redwoods that lean accelerate their growth on their downhill sides to strengthen themselves and prevent leaning further or falling over.</p>\n<p><strong>8. There are dozens of hiking trails throughout the park.</strong></p>\n<p>Hikers can explore nearly 200 miles of hiking trails on the coastline and inland. In some areas, horses and bikes are allowed on the trails. Most of the trails can be hiked year-round, but it is advisable to stop at one of the five visitor centers throughout the park.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The park continues to draw huge numbers of visitors each year.</strong></p>\n<p>Since 1971, the number of visitors has increased approximately 100,000 each year with the largest number recorded in 1988 of 677,135.

Their main purpose is to block the spray of salt water.</p>\n<p>Be sure to do your research to find the best time to visit Redwood National Park.
