  "long_description": "<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a novice or an expert at golf, you&rsquo;ll enjoy playing a few holes at the Mount St. Helena Golf Course during your stay in Napa Valley. Located in Calistoga, CA, just 8 miles from the Wine Country Inn in the town of St. Helena, this 9-hole course was designed to appeal to golfers of all skill levels with the bonus of a picture-perfect backdrop of Mount St. Helena itself!</p>\n<p>Mount St. Helena Golf Course opened in 1956 was designed by Jack Fleming, an architect who designed 25 courses in the Golden State. Other courses in the area that Fleming developed include Meadowood Golf Course (private) in St. Helena and Napa Golf Course (public) at Kennedy Park in Napa.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Mount St. Helena Golf Course\" href=\"http://www.mtsthelenagolfcourse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mount St. Helena Golf Course</a> offers a par-34 course with 9 holes spread out over 2,759 yards. Beginners will appreciate the open architecture and flat layout while more experienced golfers will enjoy the challenge of its tree-lined fairways. Only have time to hit a few balls? Stop by the driving range, constructed in 2012. Rates for 9 holes and the driving range are very reasonable, and it&rsquo;s the perfect way to spend a couple of hours in the fresh morning air and beautiful surroundings before a fun-filled day of wine tastings, hiking, biking or other popular Napa Valley activities!</p>\n<h4>Other Golf Courses in Napa Valley</h4>\n<p>If you have set several mornings aside for golf during your visit to Wine Country, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed by the selection of courses at various price points.

Start with a delicious breakfast at the Wine Country Inn, which is sure to provide you with all the energy you need for a round of golf first thing in the morning. Most wineries don&rsquo;t open until at least 10, so there is plenty of time for you to hit a few balls and enjoy a bit of time outdoors in the beautiful California sun.</p>\n<p>No matter how you faired on the golf course, you&rsquo;ll enjoy the next portion of your day exploring a select few of the hundreds of excellent vineyards in the region.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Castello di Amorosa\" href=\"http://www.castellodiamorosa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Castello di Amorosa</a> is one of our favorite <a title=\"Calistoga wineries\" href=\"https://winecountryinn.com/blog/calistoga-wineries/\">Calistoga wineries</a>.
