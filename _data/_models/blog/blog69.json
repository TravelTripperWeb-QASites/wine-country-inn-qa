  "long_description": "<p>Most of Napa Valley's known history stretches back to the mid-1800s when Native Americans saw an influx of settlers from Europe and Asia in search of gold. A trip to the <a title=\"Napa Valley Museum\" href=\"http://www.napavalleymuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Napa Valley Museum</a> in Yountville takes you back in time to learn about the early settlers of this region, how they made their living, as well as the area's evolution into a mecca for wine lovers.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1972, the Napa Valley Museum has occupied two locations. Its first home was in Vintage Hall in St. Helena and its second (and current) home was custom-built in 1998 in Yountville. The museum houses three galleries, each focusing on something different: local history, world-class art exhibitions and a showcase featuring local artists.</p>\n<h4>What will you learn at the Napa Valley Museum?</h4>\n<p>When the museum was founded, a group of local individuals wanted to find a way to teach locals and visitors alike about Napa's regional heritage. Since the beginning, it has focused on celebrating the Valley's history, environment and culture.</p>\n<p>Through a collection of art and artifacts on display, visitors can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn about the unique geological make-up of the Valley that has made it one of the premier wine-growing regions in the world.</li>\n<li>Discover the Valley's rich and dynamic history, from the original Native American culture and wine industry personalities to the lives and contributions of Chinese workers, German and Italian immigrants, migrant laborers and more.</li>\n<li>Enjoy exhibitions of local and regional artists including painting, sculpture, photography, print-making, film, video and crafts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Napa Valley's Vibrant Arts Community</h4>\n<p>The Napa Valley Museum is just one piece of the puzzle that makes up Napa Valley's vibrant arts community. There are numerous museums, <em><a title=\"art galleries and performing art centers\" href=\"http://www.visitnapavalley.com/napa_valley_arts_and_culture.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">art galleries and performing art centers</a></em> for you to experience Napa Valley's arts and culture year-round.</p>\n<h4>Getting to the Napa Valley Museum</h4>\n<p>The Napa Valley Museum is a beautiful 20-minute drive from the Wine Country Inn by car, or a little over an hour on a bike via the Silverado Trail.
