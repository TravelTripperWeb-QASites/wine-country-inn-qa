Surrounded by lush vineyards and mountains, the beauty of this winery is as captivating as its wine. This winery sources its grapes from different terrains all over the Valley to create unique, balanced, complex wines. The tasting room is open daily from 10- 6 o&rsquo;clock, and private tastings are available by appointment. The best part is that your pup can tag along, as long as it is on a leash!</p>\n<p><strong>Castello di Amorosa</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/castello-di-amorosa/\">Castello di Amorosa</a> is a Tuscan-style castle tucked away in the corner of a forest surrounded by its sprawling vineyard. Lavish wine tasting tours will take you throughout the 121,000-square-foot castle and its 107 rooms. You can discover four underground levels and vast caves for barrel aging as well as the expansive vineyards of the 83-acre property. The wine is nothing less than exquisite with its hand-crafted Italian-style flavors, and special tour options create an all-around incredible wine tasting experience. Your four-legged friend can&rsquo;t join you in the tasting room or gift shop, but you&rsquo;re both welcome on self-guided tours and on the spacious grounds outside the castle!</p>\n<p><strong>Honig Vineyard &amp; Winery</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.honigwine.com/\">Honig Vineyard &amp; Winery</a> is a family-run establishment in the center of Napa Valley.
