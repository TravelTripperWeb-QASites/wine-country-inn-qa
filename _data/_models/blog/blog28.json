It includes some of our favorite wine tours in a variety of locations throughout Napa Valley.</p>\n<h4>A Winemaking History</h4>\n<p>Founded in 1862, the Schramsberg Winery begins with the story of a German immigrant. Jacob Schram made his home and started his winery on Diamond Mountain. Over a century later, Jack and Jamie Davies restored his elegant estate and set out to produce sparkling wine. A strong spirit of innovation is still a significant aspect of Schramsberg Wine today. These wines also play an important role in political history. The Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs was used for President Nixon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Toast to Peace&rdquo; with China&rsquo;s Zhou Enlai. Ever since then, sparkling wines have been served at official state functions by every U.S. administration!</p>\n<h4>Touring &amp; Tasting Schramsberg Wine</h4>\n<p>During your stay at The Wine Country Inn, you will be overwhelmed with the variety of wines to sample in Napa Valley. However, at Schramsberg Wine, you will have the niche of sparkling wine to help narrow the spectrum. A one-and-a-half-hour <a title=\"tour and tasting combination\" href=\"http://www.schramsberg.com/visit/visitor-center/\">tour and tasting combination</a> is highly recommended. This includes a tour of the historic 125-year-old wine caves, an introduction to the classic method of producing sparkling wines, and a hand-selected variety of Schramsberg creations. There is also an option for a lavish wine and cheese pairing and tour. You must make an appointment in advance for these special experiences!</p>\n<h4>Cheers!</h4>\n<p>Red wine lovers, rejoice! While Schramsberg Wine offers only sparkling varieties, the adjoining <a title=\"Davies Vineyards\" href=\"http://www.daviesvineyards.com/\">Davies Vineyards</a> includes a Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir option. Or, if you are a champagne lover, stick to the bubbles. The Schramsberg Rose is a particularly favorite flavor, while the historic Blanc de Blanc is tried and true. So whether you come for the sparkling wine or the classic California reds, you will not be disappointed. What a marvelous combination!</p>\n<h4>The Wine Country Inn Will Help Select Your Perfect Wine Experiences</h4>\n<p>There are currently more than 500 wineries in Napa Valley and several kinds of wine tours!
