  "long_description": "<p>Since I either helped my parents run the Inn or ran it myself for the last 40 years you ought to get to know me a little, too.</p>\n<p>In my high school days my father's favorite descriptor for me was \"dissolute,\" and when I complained that I didn't even know what that meant his only comment was \"see, if you weren't a dissolute you'd look it up.\" And he was probably right. This word, which he learned by randomly opening the dictionary every week and picking out a word he was unfamiliar with, certainly didn't apply to my two older brothers. My eldest brother Dave was a staunch \"hawk\" as we called them in those days, straight A's, pro-Vietnam, student body something &ndash; definitely a mover/shaker. My next oldest brother Doug was equally determined, but in exactly the opposite direction; a full-on hippie activist, artist extraordinaire and gleeful corruptor of his younger brother.</p>\n<p>And then there was me, the dissolute. I could get decent grades if I applied myself, which I didn't, I had no artistic or athletic skill that I was aware of and my only driving desire in life was to get laid. Sure I was the leader or at least co-leader of my little clique, and I was the younger brother of the notorious troublemaker who got suspended from high school for refusing to say the Pledge Of Allegiance, but I was probably a few inches shorter than most of the girls in my sophomore class and they were all hell-bent on dating the seniors or, as a last resort, the juniors. I was the third-to-smallest kid in my 8th grade graduating class and my first driver's license at 16 described me as 5'3\" 113 lbs. Some eighteen months later I had sprouted to 5'11\" but still only tipped the scales at about 130. Well into my 30s when I had settled into my final height of 6'2\" I was still wearing 28\" jeans. I can remember having to buy XL shirts and hand-pleating them in the back every time I would tuck them in to try to keep them from looking like a balloon on me.</p>\n<p>It's pretty obvious to me that this is where my real interest in food started. I was eating everything in sight and was still, as a friend's mother called me, Auschwitz-thin. Over the next few years I can remember going out to breakfast at the Yountville Diner (I still miss that place) and eating two complete \"workingman's\" breakfasts in one sitting and still shaking for more food three hours later. I simply could not eat enough and would devour anything put in front of me. That skinniness, coupled with the fact that I was definitely hanging out with the wrong crowd, left me with no chance in hell with the girls, let alone getting their parents to agree to a date.</p>\n<p>With my true ambition effectively blocked, all I could see to do was party and cruise. Main Street St. Helena was not exactly a hopping place back in the late 60's and early 70's (and I'm sure it still isn't for anyone in high school) and I'm not really sure why my parents loaned me the car as much as they did, but I can remember spending endless evenings cruising the strip from the A&amp;W to, say, Morrison's Funeral Home &ndash; but wait, I just remembered, I went further than that!</p>\n<p>There was this one girl who lived on Main Street, just up from the police station, who seemed to spend as much time on her front porch as I spent in my parents' car. Cute as could be, about my age and completely unknown to me. The house she lived in is still there and about as beat-up as it was back then. But I didn't know her. How could I not have seen this girl at school? There were only 400 kids in total. &nbsp;Even though our love affair went on for easily a couple years we never actually met since the times I would finally ball up the courage to stop the car and talk to this beauty her mother would magically appear on the porch. Our faces would fall and I would drive on.</p>"
