The idea of creating a chamber music festival in Napa Valley was developed by orchestra musicians Michael Adams and Daria Adams. During the first year, guests were invited into the home of Michael&rsquo;s parents for a modest house performance. From there, the festival was budded, blossoming into a series of six concerts to be held just three months later. Originally slated as a two-week festival, an accidental booking turned it into a three-week event. During the second season, a dozen performers played at Spottswoode Winery, the <a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/the-culinary-institute-of-america-napa-a-treat-for-your-tastebuds/\">Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena</a>, Rutherford Winery, <a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/schramsberg-wine/\">Schramsberg Winery</a>, and more. Now, the festival is held at even more venues and features even more talented musicians each and every year!</p>\n<h4>Music in the Vineyards Quartets &amp; Artists 2017</h4>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s Music in the Vineyards Festival will take place from Friday, August 4 to Sunday, August 27. This incredible annual event features some of the best chamber music in the world.

Other familiar faces returning include flutist Lorna McGhee, violinist Axel Strauss, conductor Osmo Vanska, and pianists Wei-Yi Yang and Michael Brown.</p>\n<h4>Vineyard Venues</h4>\n<p>A variety of Napa Valley wineries will be participating in this year&rsquo;s Music in the Vineyards.
