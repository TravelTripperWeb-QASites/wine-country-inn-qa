According to <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-olive-oil-and-extra-virgin-olive-oil-word-of-mouth-218767\"><strong>TheKitchn.com</strong></a>, olive oil is graded according to its level of acidity or free oleic acid. The amount of free oleic acid in olive oil tells you the extent to which fat has broken down into fatty acids. EVOO has a low level of oleic acid and is considered an unrefined oil since it&rsquo;s not treated with chemicals, heated or cooled. EVOO is more expensive than Virgin Olive Oil. It burns faster and at a lower temperature. EVOO is best used in salads and for dipping (our favorite!).</p>\n<p>No matter which olive oil you decide is your favorite, experiencing the tasting rooms and learning about the art of making olive oil will certainly be memorable &hellip; and delicious!</p>\n<h4>Select our Experience Napa Valley Package</h4>\n<p>Napa Valley is filled with rolling hills and beautiful vineyards as well as some of the top restaurants and wineries in the world.
