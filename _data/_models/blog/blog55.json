Don&rsquo;t just stay at a run-of-the-mill hotel &hellip; especially when you come to the wine country.</p>\n<p>Instead, the perfect place would include <a title=\"private luxury cottages\" href=\"https://winecountryinn.com/rooms/\">private luxury cottages</a> tucked away from everyone overlooking vineyards, as well as a selection of rooms that are just as incredible but keep the budget-conscious traveler in mind.</p>\n<p>Here at the Wine Country Inn in St. Helena, we offer just that. We also designed our accommodations to allow couples luxurious accommodations in which to reconnect on their Napa Valley romantic getaway. After a day spent exploring the local vineyards, snuggle up on the sofa, by a lazy fire or in a jetted tub for two. We created an oasis down a secluded country lane that allows you time to sit back, relax and enjoy the surroundings, as well as time to be alone with your loved one without distractions (no televisions!).</p>\n<h4>Things to Do</h4>\n<p>No doubt, visiting wineries will be at the top of your list of things to do during your romantic getaway to Napa Valley. And no matter how many times you return to the wine country, <a title=\"established and new wineries\" href=\"http://www.napavintners.com/napa_valley/\">established and new wineries</a> alike will offer incredible tastings and behind-the-scenes tours.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Napa Valley wine tours\" href=\"https://winecountryinn.com/blog/best-napa-valley-wine-tours/\">Napa Valley wine tours</a> offer an unforgettable day of great wine, wonderful food and unparalleled scenery.
