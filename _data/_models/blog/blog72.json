  "long_description": "<p>When you&rsquo;re planning a trip to Napa Valley, St. Helena is a charming city that is well worth a visit. But where is St. Helena? This quaint city that covers a little over 5 square miles is actually in the center of Napa Valley. Long a rural agricultural center, St. Helena has blossomed along with the region&rsquo;s wine industry.</p>\n<h4>Where is St. Helena?</h4>\n<p>St. Helena in Napa County is considered part of the &ldquo;North Bay&rdquo; region since it is just 65 miles north of San Francisco. It&rsquo;s also less than 80 miles from Sacramento. With airports in each large city and well-traveled roads leading to St. Helena, this Napa Valley city is an easy getaway from anywhere in the U.S.</p>\n<h4>History of St. Helena</h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that when early travel meant hopping on a horse or climbing in a wagon, getting to the region now known as St. Helena was tough. However, that proved to be an advantage. Because of the fact that it was difficult to get to by horse and buggy, much of the land was preserved and remained in a pristine state. As time went on and people did settle the area, the region&rsquo;s beautiful countryside became the focus of preservation efforts. In fact, in 1960, just 100 years after St. Helena was established, Napa Valley adopted one of the first agricultural land protection policies in the U.S.</p>\n<p>St. Helena&rsquo;s first settlers were mainly farmers who soon learned the land offered conditions ripe for growing grapes. The first vintners to set their foot into the wine-making industry were Dr. George Beldon Crane and Charles Krug. The Crane Vineyard is now the <strong><a title=\"Beckstoffer Heritage Vineyard\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beckstoffervineyards.com%2Fheritage&amp;ei=1cVZVZf7D8f3yQSrs4DgBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG46Is68tuKZXSB1ohI0bdC6GWQnw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beckstoffer Heritage Vineyard</a></strong> and the <strong><a title=\"Charles Krug Winery\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskrug.com%2F&amp;ei=7MVZVZeJIMzzsAWx3oOIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJeS0EhdXZzTqF830Xj4jZ9k0umA&amp;bvm=bv.93564037,d.aWw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charles Krug Winery</a></strong> is still in existence today.
