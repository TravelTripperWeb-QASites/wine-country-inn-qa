  "long_description": "<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The Wine Country Inn opened on August 15, 1975 with 14 individually decorated guest rooms,&nbsp;all decked out in antique furnishings, wallpaper or 100-year-old barn wood on the walls with accents of&nbsp;family-made stitcheries, along with family-made quilts for the beds. My parents, Ned and Marge, had&nbsp;infected the whole family with this new Bed &amp; Breakfast craze and pretty much the whole family jumped&nbsp;into the project.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">My mother quit her job as an elementary school remedial reading teacher to head up the&nbsp;decorating crew while my grandmother Nummy, my sister Kate and my then-wife Nita dove into the&nbsp;needlework. Later, when wallpaper and upholstery fabrics were being chosen Mom drafted a neighbor,&nbsp;Sally Tantau, to help her with further decorating. My brother Doug, at age 23, was already a talented&nbsp;carpenter and woodworker so my father approached him to run the construction crew. Since somebody&nbsp;was needed to do the grunt work I was elected for that at age 21. Even my 12-year-old brother Jeff came&nbsp;in most days after school to sweep up the extreme messes that the carpenters always left behind.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Three generations of the Smith family were hard at work, with my father cracking the whip. And&nbsp;of course we all had friends who turned up on our doorsteps looking for work, all of whom had basic&nbsp;skills of one sort or another. Like me, I guess. I didn&rsquo;t have any actual training as a stonemason but that&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t stop my father. When it came time for the stone fa&ccedil;ade for the building my father elected me as&nbsp;stonemason even though my training consisted only of working high school summers at the family&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;ranch&rdquo; in the wilds of Sonoma County (stories of this fabled place to come), building rock walls to&nbsp;flatten out garden plots or create a little parking.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">My father&rsquo;s whole concept was to build something new that looked like it had been sitting atop&nbsp;this knoll in the middle of the Napa Valley for a hundred years. Dad insisted that all of the architects of&nbsp;his era were trained to design new, modern, sleek buildings. So instead, my father decided to hire another&nbsp;neighbor, Jim Hastings, who was a commercial artist and a bit of a history buff. Since my father had been&nbsp;selling real estate in Napa Valley for a few years he knew all the historic buildings he wanted Jim to&nbsp;amalgamize into this dream lodge. Soon the dining room table at the family home had been taken over,&nbsp;strewn with elevations (drawings of the exteriors) and floor plans. My father would bribe us all with free&nbsp;food and wine if we would come over and critique his creations. The passion he displayed for this new&nbsp;project was undeniable so I soon found that I had quit my job as a local pizza maker (they certainly didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;call us chefs back in those days) and instead could be found in a leaky, dark, dirt-floor barn breathing in&nbsp;stinky (and probably quite hazardous) chemical fumes from the stripping goop I was using to bubble and&nbsp;peel old paint and varnishes from piles of antique beds, dressers and armoires my father had already&nbsp;collected long before he had rounded up the money and permits he would need to build the Inn. Spending&nbsp;the winter wearing rubber gloves, a little surgeon&rsquo;s mask and toxic chemicals, all alone in a cold drafty&nbsp;barn out in the middle of nowhere soon made me long for the warm pizza ovens.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; line-height: 1.8; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The spring of 1974 arrived and my father had another brilliant idea. He had been out shopping for&nbsp;the rocks we would need to face the stone tower that he and Jim Hastings had designed and was now&nbsp;deciding that we should face the whole first floor.&nbsp;It appeared to be way too expensive to buy the stone he would need, and, after all, it was just&nbsp;rock! Rock is everywhere in the Napa Valley. So he asked me to find a buddy to head out and pick up&nbsp;some rock; literally, his instructions were to drive around the roads in his old pickup truck and when you&nbsp;see a rock or two, jump out and throw &rsquo;em in the back! So we did. My best buddy Bill and I spent&nbsp;probably a month cruising the backroads of the Upper Napa Valley &ldquo;stoning.&rdquo; We drove around shirtless,&nbsp;with windows rolled down and long hair flowing, wearing beat-up jeans. Sometimes we would stop by&nbsp;the side of the road for half an hour, maybe longer, looking for rocks. Stoning was fun, but pretty soon&nbsp;my father figured out that free rocks were not so free (in fact the running joke among the crew was that&nbsp;my father would spend ten bucks to save one every time).</p>"
