  "long_description": "<p><strong>A trip to the West Coast is not complete without seeing some of the largest trees in the world &mdash; the Northern California Redwoods.</strong> These gigantic trees, which are native to California, can be found in several protected parks that are easy to access and well worth a visit. Some of the trees have reached &ldquo;champion&rdquo; status, meaning they are the largest of their kind according to their trunk circumference, height and the average crown spread.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you plan a visit to the Northern California Redwoods, be sure to download our free Northern California Travel Guide!</strong></p>\n<h4>Humboldt Redwoods State Park</h4>\n<p><a title=\"The Humboldt Redwoods State Park\" href=\"http://humboldtredwoods.org/\">The Humboldt Redwoods State Park</a> is about a 3.5 hour drive from the Wine Country Inn and offers a magnificent 31-mile scenic drive called the Avenue of Giants. This drive along Highway 101 contains the largest remaining stand of virgin redwoods in the world, as well as one of the oldest trees (950 years old), and some of the tallest (346 feet and growing).</p>\n<p>We encourage you to stop along the way at access points and walk the trails. Although, you&rsquo;ll probably have a hard time keeping your eyes on the path, for looking up, up and up at some of the most magnificent trees in the world.</p>\n<p>Trees you&rsquo;ll experience on the Avenue of the Giants include the famous Drive-Through Tree, also called the <a title=\"Chandelier Tree\" href=\"http://www.drivethrutree.com/\">Chandelier Tree</a>. Located in Leggett, Ca., this tree is 315 feet tall with a 6-foot by 6-foot hole cut through its base to allow a car to drive through. (You&rsquo;ll have to be in a small one.) In addition to the Chandelier Tree, there are other trees to drive through, including the Klamath Tour Thru Tree and the Shrine Drive-Thru Tree, all of which charge a fee to drive through.</p>\n<h4>Redwood National Park</h4>\n<p>One spot you must visit to experience the Northern California Redwoods is the Redwood National Park. Located along U.S. 101 between Crescent City and Orick, Calif., the park is about a four-hour drive from the Wine Country Inn. The chance to see the amazing Redwoods is something you will not soon forget.</p>\n<p>When people were heading west to California in the 1800s, they discovered gold and redwoods. These massive trees were cut down and sold as lumber and over the next 100 years, the number of redwoods was reduced to just a fraction of what originally stood. In the 1920s, three state parks were formed to help protect the redwoods. Congress took it a step further in 1968 when it created the Redwood National Forest, which is jointly managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the National Park Service.</p>\n<p>Visit the website for info on the wildlife that lives there, as well as all of <a title=\"the things you can do in the park\" href=\"http://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/things2do.htm\">the things you can do in the park</a>.
