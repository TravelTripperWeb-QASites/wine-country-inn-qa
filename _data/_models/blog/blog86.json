  "long_description": "<p>For about 100 years, leisure and business travelers have been able to hop on a plane and fly to another city or country. It&rsquo;s fascinating, really, the way technology has developed this mode of transportation that has become the preferred way to travel for so many &ndash; even for short distances. <a title=\"The Pacific Coast Air Museum\" href=\"http://pacificcoastairmuseum.org/\">The Pacific Coast Air Museum</a> in Santa Rosa, CA celebrates aviation history and the invention of aircraft through a fun and educational experience. Whether you have a passionate interest in aviation or just want to experience an interesting activity, the Pacific Coast Air Museum may well be worth a visit and the best part is, it&rsquo;s only a 35-minute drive from Wine Country Inn!</p>\n<h4>What to Expect at the Pacific Coast Air Museum</h4>\n<p><strong>Exhibits and Aircraft</strong></p>\n<p>There are many exhibits and planes in the museum that document local aviation history including the first man in America to complete a motorized air mail flight (which was completed in Santa Rosa), light attack bomber planes, air-combat fighters, and more! One of the most popular exhibits at the museum is the &ldquo;<a title=\"First Responder&rdquo; F-15 Eagle\" href=\"http://www.pacificcoastairmuseum.org/exhibits/FirstResponder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">First Responder&rdquo; F-15 Eagle</a>, the plane that was the first to react to the World Trade Center attacks in New York on 9/11. The exhibit is designed to honor those who lost their lives on that fateful day and tell little-known stories about the pilots of the planes who reacted to the attack and the quick decisions that had to be made.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Cockpit Weekends</strong></p>\n<p>This is your chance to see what it&rsquo;s like to sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat of an aircraft! Every weekend, the doors of select aircraft are open to the public so they may look inside vintage fighter planes, helicopters, attack planes, and transports all while learning about their history, how they were used, and the crews who restored them.
