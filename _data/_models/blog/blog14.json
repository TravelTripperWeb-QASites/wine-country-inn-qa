It opened to a movie-hungry audience in 1913 and showed sold-out featured presentations of Kings of the Forest, produced by one of the most well-known silent film companies.</p>\n<p>With 400 seats, 150 opera chairs, a modern stage, and two standing sets, the G&amp;G was &ldquo;the place&rdquo; to not only see a movie but other performances as well. Back in the day, if you were going to see a show or attend a special event, you were going to the G&amp;G.</p>\n<p>Over many decades, the theater changed hands and names but experienced a rebirth of sorts when a woman named Charlotte Wagner took over the lease in 1996, upgraded the theater, and renamed it the Cameo Cinema. Further improvements were made when Cathy Buck took over the lease from Wagner in 2008. Buck, through a partnership with Nimbus Arts, installed digital sound and projection equipment. Now, this small but mighty theater in St. Helena rivals the biggest and the best in the nation.</p>\n<h4>Fun facts about the Cameo Cinema in St. Helena</h4>\n<p>The Cameo Cinema celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2013.
