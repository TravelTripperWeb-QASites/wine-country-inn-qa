  "long_description": "<p>When you are planning a visit to one of the most beloved wine regions in the world, you probably want to know which wineries you should put at the top of your list. Here in the California Wine Country, we are surrounded by small, boutique wineries that produce small amounts of mind-blowing wines, as well as large, well-established wineries that provide wines with a taste as big and beautiful as the vineyards themselves. Try one of each, or try them all if you will be here for a few days. To get you started, here&rsquo;s a list of 23 of the Best Napa Valley Wineries to visit.</p>\n<h4>Best Napa Valley Wineries to Visit</h4>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll begin with some of the most established in the region, which also of course classify as some of the best Napa Valley Wineries to visit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Sutter Home\" href=\"http://www.sutterhome.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sutter Home</a> &ndash; This winery&rsquo;s history stretches back to 1874 when a Swiss-German immigrant named John Thomann began a small winery and distillery. The estate, including a beautiful Victorian home, was later purchased by the Leunberger family, who renamed the winery Sutter Home. Later, a third family purchased the estate and winery, the Trincheros, who in the 1970s would create the trendy White Zinfandel wine that became a household name. Today, Sutter Home remains one of the largest family run, independent wineries in the U.S. It produces more than 20 varietals including its famous White Zinfandel. When you visit, be sure to explore the gardens, and of course, the tasting room!</li>\n<li><a title=\"Charles Krug &ndash; Peter Mondavi Family\" href=\"https://www.charleskrug.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charles Krug &ndash; Peter Mondavi Family</a> &ndash; Founded in 1861 by Prussian immigrant Charles Krug, this winery has had its roots firmly planted in the wine business for many years with great success. In the 1940s, the winery saw new ownership with a member of the Mondavi family. Under the management of the Mondavi family, the winery has flourished and today use state-of-the-art processes to turn the harvests from its more than 850 prime acres in the Napa Valley into the delicious wines that are served today in its award-winning Redwood Cellar and on tables across the country.</li>\n<li><a title=\"Beringer Vineyards\" href=\"http://www.beringer.com/visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beringer Vineyards</a> &ndash; Beringer Vineyard&rsquo;s story begins in 1884 when Jacob Beringer arrived from Germany and with his brother Frederick established one of the first wineries in Napa. The brothers&rsquo; first harvest and first crush yielded 40,000 gallons of wine, or 18,000 cases. A visit to this stunning estate should not be missed. Tour the demonstration vineyard to learn more about the family&rsquo;s history and their passion for making wine. Take the Legacy Cave Tour, which allows you to explore historic tunnels and the original winery.
