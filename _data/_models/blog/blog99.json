  "long_description": "<p><a title=\"Farmstead in St. Helena\" href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farmstead in St. Helena</a> features farm-to-table dishes that are prepared fresh in the restaurant&rsquo;s open kitchen. Located on a 90-acre working farm and vineyard, the restaurant itself is in what used to be a nursery barn. The look and feel of the establishment only add to the restaurant&rsquo;s mission to serve ingredient-driving farmhouse cooking. Enjoy Farmstead&rsquo;s estate-grown wines, as well as organic produce, grass-fed beef and lamb, extra virgin olive oil, Cabernet Sauvignon red wine vinegar, grappa, honey, and more.</p>\n<h4>Farmstead in St. Helena is an Irresistible Favorite</h4>\n<p><strong>Lunch, Dinner, Sunday Brunch and Dessert</strong></p>\n<p>The restaurant features a full bar and plenty of comfortable seating for family style dining. While most of the menu items are staple items, the restaurant receives a daily shipment of fresh produce from its own Rutherford Estate, 90 acres of land that is filled with organic fruits and vegetables, as well as vineyards and hand-tended beehives!</p>\n<p>Executive Chef Stephen Barber oversees the menu and the kitchen, and has infused his Southern upbringing in Kentucky into the style of food Farmstead in St. Helena offers.</p>\n<p>Farmstead serves all of the above meals with a flair that is decidedly their own. Whether it&rsquo;s the Local petrale sole with wood roasted cauliflower, carrots, leeks and blood orange butter <a title=\"for lunch\" href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/images/pdf-downloads/LUNCH_May.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for lunch</a>; the Sauteed potato gnocchi with braised greens, cauliflower, celery root puree, brown butter and parmesan <a title=\"for dinner\" href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/images/pdf-downloads/DINNNER_5.21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for dinner</a>; or the Farmstead benedict with 62 degree eggs, smoked pork, hot sauce hollandaise and crispy potatoes <a title=\"for brunch\" href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/images/pdf-downloads/Brunch_5_21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for brunch</a>, you will enjoy an incredible meal.</p>\n<p>Since the restaurant is located in the heart of the Wine Country, of course, wine is an important part of every meal. The wine list is extensive and has been carefully curated by Chris Hall. It features an array of delicious Napa Valley wines, as well as <a title=\"Long Meadow Ranch&rsquo;s own blends\" href=\"https://shop.longmeadowranch.com/shop/wine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Long Meadow Ranch&rsquo;s own blends</a>.</p>\n<h4>Corkage for Community</h4>\n<p>Many restaurants charge a $10-$20 corkage fee for opening a bottle of wine brought to a restaurant, but Farmstead has a different approach. Instead, they collect $5 for every guests&rsquo; bottle. This money is donated to a different community-based not-for-profit organization once a month.</p>\n<h4>Visit the Vineyard</h4>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re intrigued by Long Meadow Ranch&rsquo;s wine, you may want to consider exploring their vineyard. The <a title=\"Mayacamas Estate Experience\" href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/things-to-do/wine-food-excursions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayacamas Estate Experience</a> allows you to explore an exquisite mountain vineyard and the incredible wine caves. Wine and olive oil are available for purchase at the estate.</p>\n<h4>Dine at Farmstead, Stay at the Nearby Wine Country Inn</h4>\n<p><a title=\"Wine Country Inn\" href=\"https://winecountryinn.com/welcome-to-wine-country-inn/\"><em>The Wine Country Inn</em></a> is the perfect home base for an unforgettable Wine Country vacation or weekend getaway.
