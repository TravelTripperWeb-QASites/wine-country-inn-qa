The interior of the building was re-designed by Howard Backen of Backen <a href=\"http://www.bgarch.com/\">Gillam Kroeger Architects</a> for a warm, comfortable, California-casual atmosphere. Guests enter through a brick patio with alfresco dining shaded by a 100-year-old fig tree. Meanwhile, the kitchen&rsquo;s wood-burning oven warms things up. The zinc top bar and cozy banquettes are ideal for grabbing a drink with friends, while the dark checkerboard stained floors add some speakeasy drama to the downstairs dining room.</p>\n<h4>Cindy&rsquo;s Backstreet Kitchen Cuisine</h4>\n<p>Make sure you arrive at Cindy&rsquo;s Backstreet Kitchen with an empty stomach!
