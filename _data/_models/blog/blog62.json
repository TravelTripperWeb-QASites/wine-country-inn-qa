Open 364 days a year, <strong>Castello di Amorosa winery</strong> visitors have the opportunity to enjoy tours, tastings, history, special events and more, all while taking in the breathtaking views that surround it.</p>\n<p><strong>For all our favorite things to do in Calistoga, including Castello di Amorosa, download our free Napa Valley Travel Guide!</strong></p>\n<h4>The Building of a Medieval Castle</h4>\n<p><a title=\"Castello di Amorosa\" href=\"http://www.castellodiamorosa.com/\">Castello di Amorosa</a> sits on 170 acres in the beautiful Napa Valley. It was the dream of Dario Sattui, a San Francisco native who grew up with an appreciation for the wine business that turned into a passion. His grandfather founded <a title=\"V. Sattui Winery\" href=\"https://www.vsattui.com/\">V. Sattui Winery</a> in St. Helena in 1885, an operation Dario runs today.</p>\n<p>When Dario first bought the Calistoga property, he thought he would simply replant historic vineyards on the rolling hills. However, his interest in Italian medieval architecture began to take hold and shape what this new venture would become: a winery with an authentic medieval castle setting where visitors could taste remarkable wines and feel as if they&rsquo;ve been transported to another time and place.</p>\n<p>After consulting with experts in the field of medieval architecture, and 15 years of construction, Dario&rsquo;s dream came to fruition. Castello di Amorosa, a 121,000-square-foot authentically styled 13th century Tuscan castle and winery, opened in 2007.</p>\n<p>Castle tours are a must, and you may choose to explore it yourself or take a guided tour to learn all the details. Either way, there is so much to see; you&rsquo;ll want to be sure you take note of several impressive features including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,000-pound hand-hewn doors from Italy.</li>\n<li>The Great Hall with a coffered ceiling (22-feet high) featuring hand-painted frescoes and a 500-year-old fireplace.</li>\n<li>The 12,000-square-foot Grand Barrel room with 40 Roman Cross vaulted brick ceilings.</li>\n<li>Ironwork hand-forged by Italian artists over an open flame.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Guided Tours and Tastings</h4>\n<p>There are five different experiences available at the Castello di Amorosa winery. You&rsquo;ll want to know that delicious chocolate, cheese or charcuterie pairings are available as add-ons to any tour, and reservations are recommended for all guided and specialty tour experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>General Admission:</strong> Explore the winery at your leisure.
