  "long_description": "<p>There are several incredible ways to experience the beauty of Napa Valley. Some of our favorites include a self-guided leisurely drive, an excursion aboard the Napa Valley Wine Train and Napa Valley balloon rides. Each option allows you to take in the incredible view, but Napa Valley hot air balloon rides, taken in the early morning when the rest of region is just waking up, certainly offer a different perspective of the rolling valleys and majestic mountains.</p>\n<h4>Sunrise flight</h4>\n<p>Several local companies offer Napa Valley balloon rides. No matter which one you choose, your incredible experience will begin very early. Plan to meet your FAA-certified pilot, crew and other guests before sunrise.</p>\n<p>The early morning start is required because the best time for flying a hot air balloon is in the morning, just after sunrise when the winds are calmest and temperatures the coolest.</p>\n<p>Flights usually last about an hour, however, it can vary depending on the wind speed. Your altitude will vary, as well. Average altitudes vary between 1,000 and 3,000 feet above the ground. Your entire hot air balloon adventure will last about 3.5-4 hours, which includes pre-flight instructions, the flight itself and a post-flight celebration with a bit of bubbly.</p>\n<p>Aside from the periodic rush of the hot air into the balloon, your ride will be quite peaceful as your soar effortlessly over the mountains and valleys.</p>\n<h4>Napa Valley balloon ride tips</h4>\n<p>Napa Valley balloon rides are popular, therefore reservations are recommended. Most travelers will choose to reserve a spot on a semi-private ride, where you share a basket and balloon with a group. Celebrating a special occasion? Consider a private flight for two (plus the pilot). Traveling with a large group? Contact the tour companies for group rates.</p>\n<p>Since your day begins quite early, we recommend dressing in layers. That will allow you to stay warm when it&rsquo;s cool and peel off the layers as the sun rises. You&rsquo;ll also be climbing in and out of a large basket, so be sure to wear comfortable clothing and shoes.</p>\n<p>The view on Napa Valley Balloon rides are incredible, so be sure to take your camera. Some companies have cameras mounted on the balloon and can provide you with pictures from your trip.</p>\n<p>While most companies are able to fly about 200 days out of the year, weather conditions can impact your flight. Stay in close contact with your tour company ahead of your flight so you&rsquo;ll be advised of a change in plans.</p>\n<p>To help take some of the guesswork out of your planning, we&rsquo;ve listed a few companies below you may consider when booking your Napa Valley balloon rides.</p>\n<h4>Napa Valley Aloft Balloon Rides</h4>\n<p><a title=\"Napa Valley Aloft\" href=\"http://nvaloft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Napa Valley Aloft</a> is a family owned and operated company that has been offering hot air balloon rides over Napa Valley for more than 30 years.

That&rsquo;s hard to imagine flying over the region now, as vineyards, with their impeccable rows of grapevines are one of the main attractions. Barbarick leads his crew of 8 pilots in flying some of the biggest hot air balloons in the U.S. Balloons Above the Valley baskets can accommodate up to 20 passengers.
