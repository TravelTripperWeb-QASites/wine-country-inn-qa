Fifty-four acres of Zinfandel vines were purchased by Bill and Kathy Collins in 1968. During this time, they were hauling the grapes from the vineyards to their friend&rsquo;s home and making wine in their basement. In less than a decade, however, Conn Creek Winery was thriving, committed to <a title=\"Bordeaux-styled red wines\" href=\"http://www.plumdeluxe.com/bordeaux-style-wine\">Bordeaux-styled red wines</a>. By 1979, they outgrew the original facility, so the current Conn Creek Winery was constructed in the first &ldquo;green&rdquo; winery building in Napa Valley. The 12-inch thick walls are constructed of styrofoam, steel mesh, and 20,000 corks!</p>\n<h4>Visit Conn Creek Winery</h4>\n<p>Located in the heart of Napa Valley, Conn Creek Winery offers a wonderful atmosphere along with a divine tasting experience.
