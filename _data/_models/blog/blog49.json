  "long_description": "<p>In Napa Valley, California, wine tasting and winery tours are one of the most popular tourist activities, especially since there are more than 400 of them in the area. Among them all, one of the best is the Robert Mondavi Winery Tour. Celebrating its 50th year, this winery is one of the finest to offer tours in the whole valley and is committed to education with world-renowned visitor programs.</p>\n<h4>Robert Mondavi Winery History</h4>\n<p>In 1966, the Robert Mondavi Winery began with a man&rsquo;s vision to create a Napa Valley wine that would stand above the rest as one of the world&rsquo;s finest. Mr. Mondavi believed that wine should reflect their origins and they are a product of the soil, climate, and a careful hand. Using only the newest techniques and technology in the wine industry, he was able to make his dream come true. He opened his winery in Kalon Vineyard, which is renowned for producing some of the world&rsquo;s best Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. He also used the Sauvignon Blanc grapes that grew there to create his signature wine, Fume Blanc.</p>\n<p>The winery continues to carry out Robert Mondavi&rsquo;s wishes every day and pursues excellence and passion with every bottle of wine.</p>\n<h4>Robert Mondavi Winery Tours and Tastings</h4>\n<p>As one of the first wineries to offer tours, Robert Mondavi Winery provides three tours.
